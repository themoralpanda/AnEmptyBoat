In the past few years, I paid a very close attention to my stomach and things I eat. Here are the points I discovered that was very helpful to myself. 


* The less, the size of the meal I have, the more I feel alert and ease after eating. 

* Eating two course meal everyday elevates my concentration at work. Especially having a brunch in the morning at around 11AM and dinner around 7PM, with a 3:30 to 4pm small snack break. 

* Skipping Lunch makes me more focussed in the afternoon sessions. I experimented with just having a small cup of fruits (say 5 to 6 pieces) or just an apple alone. With this, I found myself to be more productive and alert in the afternoon sessions at work. 

* Avoiding the combo and opting for a single item of food. This had been a signficant discovery, that really helped me. For example, when I go for team lunches with my office colleagues, Usually people opt for standard set meals, which are basically cost effective combos that include a soup, a maincourse and a drink. I started just buying maincourse separately and ignore soup and a drink often, even if its not cost effective. And this has been great. Just one meal and not mixing with things. **This made my stomach feel very light, after eating**

* Not drinking water right after eating. And taking a minimum of 45 minutes to 1 hour before I drink water. And when I do, I dont drink small sips of water regularly. Rather, I drink close to 400ml of water and take a break of few hours before I drink my next big portion. **This I still donot understand and articulate the benifits that this is causing. But I can just feel it** 

* My **listening ability** in the conversations with colleagues or in meetings at office become less effective if my stomach does not feel good either by eating too much or by improper bowel movements.
